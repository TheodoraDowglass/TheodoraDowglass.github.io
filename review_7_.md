### Final Classification: **Outstanding**

---

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation

Lacking consistency in page design beyond the background and navbar colouration.

Style drastically changes between pages, causing discontinuity.

A generalised css file to be shared between pages may cause more consistent style

### Final Classification: **Good**
---

## Validity of html

File structure is disorganised, making it difficult to navigate.

Files are named inconsistently

### Index
- Use of deprecated element `<center>`

### Kaal
- Use of deprecated element `<center>`
- No `alt` attribute on `<img>` tags
- Inline CSS used rather than external file

### Liam
- Fonts loaded prior to opening `<head>` tag, resulting in a lack of consistency across browsers where a head tag will automatically be added

### Benedict
- Unnecessary closing tag `</p>`

### Shanai
- No `lang` attribute specified
- No `<title>` element
- `@import` used after CSS rulesets, causing invalid CSS
- Empty `<h3>` tag
- Stray ending `</div>` tags
- Inline CSS used rather than external file

### Theo
- Use of SaSS notation in vanilla CSS `$primary`
- Invalid dimension `1s0px`
- Use of deprecated element `<center>`
- No `alt` attribute on `<img>` tags
- Inline CSS used rather than external file

### Final Classification: **Sound**
